# Social-media-sentimental-analysis
## Project Objective
In the digital realm, social media platforms stand as influential conduits for individuals to voice their opinions and sentiments. This project, titled Tweet Sentiment Analysis for Deep Learning, aims to harness the prowess of deep learning algorithms to comprehensively analyze and interpret the myriad of sentiments expressed across diverse social platforms. Employing cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this initiative aspires to furnish invaluable insights into prevailing public opinions, emotions, and emerging trends.

## Data Preparation
1. Loading Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for ease of manipulation.
2. Check for Missing and Duplicate Values
Basic checks to ensure data integrity by removing null entries and duplicates.
3. Preprocessing Text
Cleaning text to remove noise (e.g., special characters, stop words, links) and standardizing for analysis.

## Data Analysis
1. Sentiment Distribution
Visualize the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
2. Tweet Length Analysis
Analyze the character and word length of tweets for feature engineering.
3. Feature Extraction
Convert text into numerical representations using methods like word embeddings or TF-IDF.
4. Tokenizing & Padding
Prepare text data by converting words to tokens and standardizing input size.

## Model Building
1. Bidirectional LSTM
Constructed a Bidirectional LSTM model to capture contextual relationships in text.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, loss metrics, and confusion matrix.
Saved the trained model for future predictions.
2. BERT Classification
Implemented BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment classification.
Processed data using BERT tokenization.
Trained the model with separate data loaders for training, validation, and testing.

## Results
Both models were evaluated on standard benchmarks, demonstrating their effectiveness in sentiment analysis. Metrics include:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision, Recall, F1 Score
3. Confusion Matrix

## Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of deep learning and NLP in analyzing sentiments from social media. By integrating Bidirectional LSTM and BERT, the project delivers a robust framework for understanding public sentiment trends, offering significant value to various stakeholders.
